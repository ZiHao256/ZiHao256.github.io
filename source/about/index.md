# About Me
I am currently a postgraduate student in Computer Science and Technology at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor's degree in software engineering from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/).

I can be referred to as Zahi Ma and Zihao Ma.

I have been focusing on learning system software, especially database systems, during my undergraduate and graduate study. I am learning CMU15-445(2023FALL) to improve my skills of C++ and database system.
